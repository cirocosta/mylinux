mylinux

        configuration intended to bootstrap an Ubuntu Disco anywhere

        curl -SL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirocosta/mylinux/master/provision.sh | bash


steps

        - copy `provision.sh` into your system
        - run it!


        (vagrant: see `./vagrant/build/Vagrantfile`) for a sample Vagrantfile)

                ps.: due to a problem with tty on the cloud image for disco
                dingo, it takes a while for the machine to boot
